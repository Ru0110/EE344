## Project Overview

This project includes the following HTML and CSS files:

* `index.html`: The main HTML page for the project.
* `style.css`: Stylesheet for the HTML page.

## Deployment

The HTML page is deployed using GitHub Pages and is currently accessible at: https://shleshgholap.github.io/EDL-Project/

## Waveform Visualization

* The `Waveform.html` file displays plots of voltage values and their periodograms. Currently, this visualization relies on a local server.
* **Enhancement:** To make the waveform visualization publicly accessible, consider migrating the plot generation process to a cloud computing service. This would enable seamless integration of the plots into the `index.html` page. 

**Key Points**

* The core HTML and CSS components are ready for deployment.
* The waveform visualization component requires modification to work within a publicly accessible deployment setup.
